Purpose

To define a standardized process for identifying, responding to, and resolving performance-related alerts and incidents through full-stack observability. This process utilizes Dynatrace for monitoring and root cause analysis and ServiceNow for incident lifecycle management.

⸻

Scope

Applies to all services, infrastructure, and environments hosted across:

Primary Data Center: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
Secondary Data Center: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Monitoring Coverage Includes:
	•	OCI & GCP compute infrastructure
	•	Production Kubernetes clusters (across both clouds)
	•	Production databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
	•	Application/API performance
	•	TLS/SSL certificates (expiry and validity monitoring)
	•	User experience monitoring (via RUM & Synthetics)

⸻

Tools Used
	•	Dynatrace – Full-stack observability, AIOps-based problem detection
	•	ServiceNow – Incident tracking, workflow automation
	•	GCP Monitoring / OCI Metrics – Native telemetry and health metrics
	•	Email / Slack / MS Teams – Alert notifications and collaboration

⸻

Full Stack Observability Components
	•	Compute Infrastructure: OCI & GCP VMs: CPU, memory, disk, network
	•	Kubernetes: Node health, pod status, deployments, control plane metrics
	•	Databases: Performance metrics, connection errors, slow queries
	•	Certificates: Expiry dates, invalid chains, renewals
	•	Applications/APIs: Throughput, latency, error rate, distributed traces
	•	Network Endpoints: Latency, packet loss, DNS, and service availability via synthetics

⸻

Real-Time Monitoring – Command Center Team
	•	The Dynatrace dashboards are continuously monitored by our Command Center team, 24x7.
	•	The team is responsible for:
	•	Watching real-time alerts and dashboards for production issues.
	•	Identifying anomalies or critical system failures.
	•	Notifying the SRE and Platform teams for triage and resolution support.
	•	Ensuring high-severity issues are escalated promptly and accurately.
	•	The Command Center serves as the first-line monitoring function in our operational workflow.

Incident Handling Workflow

1. Alert Generation in Dynatrace
	•	Dynatrace uses AI to detect anomalies in infrastructure, applications, Kubernetes, and databases.
	•	When a problem is detected:
	•	Dynatrace automatically opens a Problem with root cause analysis.
	•	The Command Center team is immediately notified.
	•	Problem triggers automated ServiceNow incident creation via integration.

2. Incident Creation in ServiceNow
	•	Each Dynatrace Problem creates a corresponding ServiceNow incident.
	•	The incident includes:
	•	Problem summary, affected services, severity, and root cause
	•	Direct links to Dynatrace traces/logs/metrics
	•	Auto-assigned to the correct resolver group based on tagging or CI mapping.

3. Triage & Escalation
	•	Command Center alerts the respective SRE and Platform teams to initiate investigation.
	•	Teams:
	•	Acknowledge the incident
	•	Review Dynatrace RCA and logs
	•	Access OCI/GCP dashboards if needed for further validation
	•	If high impact:
	•	Incident bridge is opened
	•	SMEs are pulled in from relevant domains (DB, Network, App, Platform)

4. Issue Resolution
	•	Actions may include:
	•	Restarting services or workloads
	•	Scaling nodes or reconfiguring infrastructure
	•	Fixing certificate or deployment issues
	•	Dynatrace continuously monitors resolution progress.
	•	Once the issue is resolved:
	•	Dynatrace auto-closes the Problem
	•	Linked ServiceNow incident is closed automatically with resolution notes

5. Post-Incident Review (PIR)
	•	PIR is initiated for:
	•	Production-impacting incidents
	•	Repeat or recurring problems
	•	Includes:
	•	Timeline of events
	•	RCA confirmation
	•	Impact analysis across OCI/GCP environments
	•	Preventive actions (e.g., alert tuning, infra scaling, cert automation)
